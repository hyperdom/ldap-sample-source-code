/**
 * Support for the {@code Observer} design pattern.
 * <p>
 * The {@code Observable} design pattern provides a way for clients to
 * "observe" events that transpire within the class being observed. The
 * Observable design pattern ensures loose coupling between the observed
 * and the observer.
 * <p>
 * When a noteworthy event transpires in the course of processing, the
 * observed class generates an {@code Event} which is "fired" to the
 * observers.
