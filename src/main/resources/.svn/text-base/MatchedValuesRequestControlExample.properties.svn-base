toolName = MatchedValuesRequestControlExample
toolDescription = Provides an example of the use of the MatchedValuesRequestControl. The matched \
 values request control is useful in cases where an application wants to the server to return \
 only certain values of a multi-valued attribute. The values to return match the 'matched values \
 filter'.  The user provides the options required to connect to the directory server, a base \
 object, a filter, a search scope, and a list of requested attributes plus a matched values \
 filter specified by the --matchedValuesFilter} command line argument. The demonstration displays \
 the entry returned as the result of a search request with the matched values request control \
 attached.
