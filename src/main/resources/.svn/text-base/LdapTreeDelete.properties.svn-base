toolName = Ldap Tree Delete demonstration

toolDescription = The tree delete tool provides a demonstration of how to use  the Tree Delete \
 request control to delete a branch and all entries subordinate to  the branch.  \
 \u000a \u000aThis control allows a client to delete an entire subtree.  This can only be done if the \
 authenticated user has appropriate permissions to complete the operation.  The server MUST \
 check to see if the authenticated user has appropriate permissions to delete the object and all \
 of its descendants.  This control MUST only be used with a DelRequest message.  A server MUST \
 ignore the control if used with any other message unless the criticality field is set to True, \
 in which case the entire operation MUST fail and MUST instead return the resultCode \
 unsupportedCriticalExtension as per section 4.1.12 of [RFC 2251].  The server MUST list that it \
 recognizes this control in the supportedControl attribute in the root DSE. \
 \u000a \u000aExample usage: java samplecode.delete.LdapTreeDelete --ldifFile branch.ldif --deleteBranch cn=deleteme,dc=example,dc=com \
 \u000a where branch.ldif contains cn=deleteme,dc=example,dc=com and subordinate entries.
